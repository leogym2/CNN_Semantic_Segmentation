# Semantic_segmentation-Cam_Vid

This project was developed as part of a university course on Deep Learning. 
It focuses on semantic segmentation using the CamVid dataset, which contains annotated driving scenes. 
The goal of the project is to train and evaluate deep learning models to accurately segment urban environments into meaningful classes (e.g., road, cars, pedestrians, buildings).
